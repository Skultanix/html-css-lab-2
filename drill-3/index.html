        <p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
            Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
            To the last syllable of recorded time;
            And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
            The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
            Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
            That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
            And then is heard no more. It is a tale
            Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
            Signifying nothing.</p>

        <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:
            Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
            Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
            And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
            No more; and by a sleep to say we end
            The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
            That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
            To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
            For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
            Must give us pause—there's the respect
            That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
